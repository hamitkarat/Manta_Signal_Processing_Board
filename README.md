# Manta_Signal_Processing_Board
This is my latest project. I designed this board to process signals coming from H1C hydrophone (https://www.aquarianaudio.com/h1c-hydrophone.html). The acoustic signals are first filtered and amplified via 6th order Bessel filter I designed with the help of a filter design tool (https://webench.ti.com/filter-design-tool/ ). Then it is optional to choose if user wants the signals to go to logic level shifter first and microcontroller's ADC's second, or directly to microcontroller's ADC's. After entering the ADC's, signals will be processed.
