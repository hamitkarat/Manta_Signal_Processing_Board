# Manta_Signal_Processing_Board
This is my latest project. It was made for Teknofest Unmanned Underwater Vehicle competition. In this competition, it is required to detect and process 45kHz acoustic signals coming from a pinger. I designed this board to process signals detected from H1C hydrophone (https://www.aquarianaudio.com/h1c-hydrophone.html). The acoustic signals are first filtered and amplified via 6th order Bessel filter I designed with the help of a filter design tool (https://webench.ti.com/filter-design-tool/ ). Then it is optional to choose if user wants the signals to enter logic level shifter first and microcontroller's ADC's second, or directly to microcontroller's ADC's. After entering the ADC's, signals will be processed.
